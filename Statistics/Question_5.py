Question 5 :-

A certain city has two taxi companies: Company A has 80% of the taxis and
Company B has 20% of the taxis. Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate for picking
up passengers on time, while Company B's taxis have a 90% success rate. If a randomly
selected taxi is late, what is the probability that it belongs to Company A?

## Answer-5 [Statistics] :-


Let's say there are 100 taxis in the city. 80 of them are from Company A and 20 are from Company B.

The probability that a randomly selected taxi is from Company A is 80/100 = 0.8

The probability that a randomly selected taxi is from Company B is 20/100 = 0.2

The probability that a taxi from Company A is late is 5/100 = 0.05

The probability that a taxi from Company B is late is 10/100 = 0.1

The probability that a randomly selected taxi is late and from Company A is 0.8 * 0.05 = 0.04

The probability that a randomly selected taxi is late and from Company B is 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02

The probability that a randomly selected late taxi is from Company A is 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.02) = 4/6 = 2/3


So the answer is 2/3 or approximately 0.6667.
