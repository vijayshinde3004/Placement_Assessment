## Answer-8 [Statistics] :-


The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test that can be used to compare two related samples. 
The null hypothesis for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is that there is no difference between the two 
samples. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between the two samples.

The data in the spreadsheet shows that the anxiety levels of the participants decreased after the therapy.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether this decrease was statistically significant. The 
test statistic was 72. The p-value for the test was 0.0001. This p-value is less than 0.05, which is the 
standard significance level. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a 
statistically significant difference between the anxiety levels of the participants before and after the 
therapy.
